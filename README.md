# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This Prework-Study-Guide project was created for Boot Camp students completing the Prework modules. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. The motivation for the project was to create a space for Prework students to collate their Prework notes digitially and to be practising some fundamental coding concepts in doing so. In building this project I gained an understanding of some of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git in relation to front-end web development.
